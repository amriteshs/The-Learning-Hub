1	The most widely used metrics and tools to assess a classification model are:	All of the above	Confusion matrix, Cost-sensitive accuracy, Area under the ROC curve, All of the above
2	Classification problems are distinguished from estimation problems in that	classification problems require the output attribute to be categorical	classification problems require the output attribute to be numeric,  classification problems require the output attribute to be categorical, classification problems do not allow an output attribute, classification problems are designed to predict future outcome
3	Imagine, you are solving a classification problems with highly imbalanced class. The majority class is observed 99% of times in the training data. Your model has 99% accuracy after taking the predictions on test data. Which of the following is true in such a case? <br>1. Accuracy metric is not a good idea for imbalanced class problems; <br>2. Accuracy metric is a good idea for imbalanced class problems; <br>3. Precision and recall metrics are good for imbalanced class problems; <br>4. Precision and recall metrics arenâ€™t good for imbalanced class problems.	1 and 3	1 and 3, 1 and 4, 2 and 3, 2 and 4
