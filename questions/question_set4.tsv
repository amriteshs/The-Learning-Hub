0	Which statement is true about neural network and linear regression models?	Both models require input attributes to be numeric	Both models require input attributes to be numeric, Both models require numeric attributes to range between 0 and 1, The output of both models is a categorical attribute value; Both techniques build models whose output  is determined by a  linear sum of weighted input attribute values, More than one of a b c or d is true.
1	A feed-forward neural network is said to be  fully connected when	all nodes at one layer are connected to all nodes in the next higher layer	all nodes are connected to each other, all nodes at the same layer are connected to each other, all nodes at one layer are connected to all nodes in the next higher layer, all hidden layer nodes are connected to all output layer nodes
2	Neural network training is accomplished by repeatedly passing the training data through the network while	individual network weights are modified	individual network weights are modified, training instance attribute values are modified, the ordering of the training instances is modified, individual network nodes have the coefficients on their corresponding functional parameters modified.
3	A two-layered neural network used for unsupervised clustering.	Kohonen network	backpropagation network, Kohonen network, perceptron network, aggomerative network
4	This neural network explanation technique is used to determine the relative importance of individual input attributes.	sensitivity analysis	sensitivity analysis, average member technique, mean squared error analysis, absolute average technique
5	Which one of the following is not a major strength of the neural network approach?	Neural network learning algorithms are guaranteed to converge to an optimal solution	Neural networks work well with datasets containing noisy data, Neural networks can be used for both supervised learning and unsupervised clustering, Neural network learning algorithms are guaranteed to converge to an optimal solution, Neural networks can be used for applications that require a time element to be included in the data.
