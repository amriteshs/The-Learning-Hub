0	Which of the following is a regression task?	Predicting age of a person	Predicting age of a person, Predicting nationality of a person, Predicting whether stock price of a company will increase tomorrow, Predicting whether a document is related to sighting of UFOs?
1	You have an ice-cream shop. You noticed a relationship between the number of cones you order and the number of ice-creams you sell. Is this a suitable situation for regression analysis?	No	Yes, No
2	You are trying to predict the amount of beer consumed in the US, depending on the state. Is this regression material?	Yes	Yes, No
3	Assume you have the following sample regression ŷ = 6 + x. If we draw the regression line, what would be its slope?	1	1, X, 6, None of the above
4	Suppose you have a dataset with m=50 examples and n=200000 features for each example. You want to use multivariate linear regression to fit the parameters θ to our data. Should you prefer gradient descent or the normal equation?	Gradient descent since (XTX)−1 will be very slow to compute in the normal equation.	Gradient descent since (XTX)−1 will be very slow to compute in the normal equation., Gradient descent since it will always converge to the optimal θ., The normal equation since it provides an efficient way to directly find the solution., The normal equation since gradient descent might be unable to find the optimal θ.
